# CLICK! METRONOME APP

## Description

_Duration: 2 Weeks_

CLICK! was created due to a need for a flexible and reliable metronome for musicians of all different skill levels.
As a guy who has spent the majority of his life playing music, a good metronome is one of the most important tools in my toolbelt. The CLICK! App allows the user the following:

1. Classic metronome with adjustable bpm
2. Add Song feature to save multiple tempo tracks as different tracks
3. Song Library feature to recall saved tempo tracks
4. Adjustable bpm, time signature, accent tone (the '1' of each measure), and regular tone. 
5. Tap Tempo button to 'tap' out the tempo of your song
